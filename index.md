# [Continuous Time Markov Regime Switching for Ethereum / USDC Liquidity Pool Analysis](https://github.com/aboyle3100/Optimal-Liquidity-Pool-Range/tree/main/uniswap_analysis)
* Extended Black Scholes formula for asset pricing to Ethereum to evaluate liquidity pool ranges.
* Applied Markov Switching Model to simulate regime changes in changes in asset price.
* Found best liquidity pool range to be between 2100 and 2800 ETH / USDC which would produce 6% APY.

# [Recipe Analysis Project](https://aboyle3100.github.io/recipe-analysis/)
* Analyzed over 240,000 recipes using data science best practices.
* Cleaned and preprocessed raw text data including ingredients and instructions.
* Engineered features such as ingredient counts, cooking methods, and prep time indicators.
* Built and evaluated classification models to predict recipe ratings (1â€“5 scale).
* Used techniques such as TF-IDF, PCA, and Random Forests to improve performance.
* Presented findings with interactive visualizations and concise executive summary.

# [Loan Application Predictor](https://loan-risk-predictor.streamlit.app/)
* Trained multiple classification models on german loan application data.
* Considered appropriate form of missing value imputation using hypothesis testing.
* Trained and evaluated multiple classification models  to predict loan risk.
* Evaluated models by considering metrics like F1 Score and Accuracy.
* Used Streamlit app system to create an easy to use form.
