# Welcome to my project portfolio
Hello! I'm a data-driven thinker with a background in Mathematics and Economics, currently pursuing a Master's in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis for Financial Technologies at Durham University. This portfolio showcases a selection of my projects and analyses that blend statistical rigor, algorithmic thinking, and real-world application.

Here, you'll find interactive notebooks, visual explorations, and end-to-end projects in areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and financial modeling. Whether it's uncovering patterns in complex datasets or building tools to support decision-making, my goal is to create work that’s both insightful and impactful.

# [Continuous Time Markov Regime Switching for Ethereum / USDC Liquidity Pool Analysis](visualizations/liquidity_analysis.pdf)
* Extended Black Scholes formula for asset pricing to Ethereum to evaluate liquidity pool ranges.
* Applied Markov Switching Model to simulate regime changes in changes in asset price.
* Found best liquidity pool range to be between 2100 and 2800 ETH / USDC which would produce 6% APY.

# [Recipe Analysis Project](https://aboyle3100.github.io/recipe-analysis/)
* Analyzed over 240,000 recipes using data science best practices.
* Cleaned and preprocessed raw text data including ingredients and instructions.
* Engineered features such as ingredient counts, cooking methods, and prep time indicators.
* Built and evaluated classification models to predict recipe ratings (1–5 scale).
* Used techniques such as TF-IDF, PCA, and Random Forests to improve performance.
* Presented findings with interactive visualizations and concise executive summary.

# [Loan Application Predictor](https://loan-risk-predictor.streamlit.app/)
* Trained multiple classification models on german loan application data.
* Considered appropriate form of missing value imputation using hypothesis testing.
* Trained and evaluated multiple classification models  to predict loan risk.
* Evaluated models by considering metrics like F1 Score and Accuracy.
* Used Streamlit app system to create an easy to use form.

# [Loss Triangle Analysis for IBNR Estimation Auto Claims](visualizations/IBNR_analysis.pdf)
* Developed a data pipeline and visualization tool to analyze insurance claim development using loss triangles.
* Implemented the Chain-Ladder method to estimate Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims based on historical development patterns.
* Visualized cumulative paid losses and developed development factor matrices to forecast future liabilities.
* Built interactive Python notebooks to compute and display key actuarial insights for use in reserving and financial reporting.
